# MotionFocus Library

We've all been there - excited to start a robotics project, only to get stuck wiring up motor controllers, debugging connections, and configuring electronics before even testing our first movement.

Motion Focus changes that. We've built a BLDC motor with Field oriented controll and all the essential electronics seamlessly integrated, cutting down your prototyping time dramatically.

Simply connect the motor to a power source, upload this library to configure it, and start sending commands over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, UART, or USB-C. 

No more wiring headachesâ€”just plug, configure, and play!

## Overview

MotionFocus is a specialized motor control solution that provides efficient and accurate control of BLDC motors. Our implementation focuses on reliability, performance, and ease of integration for various motion control applications. This library is a modified version of the Arduino SimpleFOC library (https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Key Features

- Multiple control modes:
  - Position control
  - Velocity control
  - Torque control
  - Open-loop control options

- Sensor Integration:
  - Magnetic encoder support
  - Flexible sensor interface

- Advanced Control Features:
  - Field Oriented Control (FOC) implementation
  - PID control systems
  - Real-time monitoring capabilities
  - Built-in motion control algorithms

## Hardware Support

The library is optimized for ESP32-based systems and supports standard BLDC motor configurations. For detailed hardware specifications and requirements, please contact our team.

## Applications

- Precision positioning systems
- Robotics and automation
- Industrial motion control
- Custom motor control solutions
- Fast prototyping
- Robotic education

## Getting started 

We are currently working on updating our library for a first release, if you have any questions or interest please contact us.
